g2u_sig_access
--------------

To hit some corner cases inside the DUT, at times engineers want to use force/deposit/release on certain signals. Though this is not a reusable code and not recommended practice, there are scenarios where it can't be avoided. Some of them are:

1. RTL Designers verifying their own RTL before handing off to DV (Design Verification) teams - to hit some FIFO full cases for instance.

2. Gate Level netlists, certain pins need to be forced
3. Avoid a long initialization sequence in a SoC simulation, and force certain values for few registers inside a UVM sequence::body()

Requirements:
*************
1. Should be able to force a signal at any level of hierarchy from UVM Test
2. Target signals can be in any HDL - Verilog/SystemVerilog/VHDL etc.
3. Code should be easy to use
4. 

Keeping the general motivation of Go2UVM - to make UVM easy to use for all users, a simple API is provided via g2u_sig_access base class. To hide all the complexity in using Vendor specific force/release API, our g2u_sig_access provides few convenient access functions at the package level so that teams can use with simple Verilog-like syntax.
